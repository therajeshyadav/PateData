Take‐Home Assignment: Pastebin‐Lite
Build a small “Pastebin”‐like application. A user can create a text paste and share a link to view it.
This assignment is used as a preliminary filter.
Your submission will be evaluated primarily by automated tests against your deployed application.
You may use Node.js / Next.js or any equivalent stack. Deployment on Vercel is recommended.
What to Submit
- A deployed URL (for example: https://your-app.vercel.app)
- A public git repository
- A short README explaining:
- how to run the app locally
- what persistence layer you used
- any important design decisions
Functional Requirements
User capabilities
1. Create a paste containing arbitrary text.
2. Receive a shareable URL for that paste.
3. Visit the URL to view the paste.
4. Pastes may become unavailable based on optional constraints.
Constraints on a Paste
A paste may optionally include one or both of the following constraints:
- Time‐based expiry (TTL)
- View‐count limit
Once a constraint is triggered, the paste becomes unavailable.
If both constraints are present, the paste becomes unavailable as soon as either constraint triggers.

Required Routes
Health check
GET /api/healthz
- Must return HTTP 200
- Must return JSON
- Must respond quickly
- Should reflect whether the application can access its persistence layer
Example response:
{ "ok": true }
Create a paste
POST /api/pastes
Request body (JSON):
{
"content": "string",
"ttl_seconds": 60,
"max_views": 5
}
Rules:
- content is required and must be a non‐empty string
- ttl_seconds is optional; if present, it must be an integer ≥ 1
- max_views is optional; if present, it must be an integer ≥ 1
Response (JSON, 2xx):
{
"id": "string",
"url": "https://your-app.vercel.app/p/<id>"
}
Error cases:
- Invalid input must return a 4xx status with a JSON error body

Fetch a paste (API)
GET /api/pastes/:id
Successful response (JSON, 200):
{
"content": "string",
"remaining_views": 4,
"expires_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
Notes:
- remaining_views may be null if unlimited
- expires_at may be null if no TTL
- Each successful API fetch counts as a view
Unavailable cases:
- Missing paste
- Expired paste
- View limit exceeded
All unavailable cases must return:
- HTTP 404
- JSON response
View a paste (HTML)
GET /p/:id
- Returns HTML (200) containing the paste content
- If the paste is unavailable, return HTTP 404
Paste content must be rendered safely (no script execution).
Deterministic Time for Testing
Your application must support deterministic expiry testing.
If the environment variable TEST_MODE=1 is set:

- The request header
x-test-now-ms: <milliseconds since epoch>
must be treated as the current time for expiry logic only
If the header is absent, use real system time.
Persistence Requirement
Automated tests run against your deployed application.
If you deploy on a serverless platform (such as Vercel), in‐memory storage alone is usually insufficient.
Use a persistence layer that survives across requests (KV/Redis/Postgres/etc), and document your
choice.
Automated Tests Your System Must Pass
Our grader will run the following checks against your deployed URL:
Service checks
- /api/healthz returns HTTP 200 and valid JSON
- All API responses return valid JSON with correct Content‐Type
- Requests complete within a reasonable timeout
Paste creation
- Creating a paste returns a valid id and url
- Returned URL points to /p/:id on your domain
Paste retrieval
- Fetching an existing paste returns the original content
- Visiting /p/:id returns HTML containing the content
View limits
- Paste with max_views = 1:
- first API fetch → 200
- second API fetch → 404
- Paste with max_views = 2:
- two successful fetches
- third fetch → 404

Time‐to‐live (TTL)
- Paste with ttl_seconds is available before expiry
- After expiry (using x-test-now-ms), paste returns 404
Combined constraints
- Paste with both TTL and max views becomes unavailable when the first constraint triggers
Error handling
- Invalid inputs return appropriate 4xx responses with JSON errors
- Unavailable pastes consistently return HTTP 404
Robustness
- No negative remaining view counts
- No serving a paste beyond its constraints under small concurrent load
UI Expectations (High‐Level)
- Users can create a paste via the UI
- Users can view a paste via the shared link
- Errors (invalid input, expired paste) are shown clearly
UI design and styling are not graded heavily, but the flows must work.
Time Expectation
This assignment is intended to take 2–4 hours.
Submission
Send us:
- Deployed URL
- Git repository URL
- Short notes (persistence choice, notable decisions)
Good luck.
Coding & Repository Guidelines (Automatically Checked)
Your submission must satisfy the following repository-level requirements.
These are checked automatically before functional tests run.

Repository structure
- A file named README.md must exist at the repository root.
- README.md must contain:
- a short project description
- instructions to run the project locally
- a note describing the persistence layer used
- The repository must not be empty and must contain source code (not only build artifacts).
Code quality signals (lightweight)
These are not stylistic nitpicks; they are simple, machine-checkable signals:
- No hardcoded absolute URLs pointing to localhost in committed code.
- No secrets, tokens, or credentials committed to the repository.
- Server-side code must not rely on global mutable state that breaks across requests in serverless
environments.
Build & runtime
- The project must install and start using standard commands documented in README.md.
- The deployed app must start successfully without manual database migrations or shell access.
Failure to meet these guidelines may result in the submission being rejected before functional testing.
